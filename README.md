# World Cup SQL
A .sql file and Shell script that build the world cup database that I created as part of the "Build a World Cup Database" challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

A second Shell script is included that uses several SQL queries to test that all of the data has been properly added, as well as to test my knowledge of SQL queries.
